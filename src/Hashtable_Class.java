/*                                                HASHTABLE

-->The Hashtable class provides a means of organizing data based on some user-defined key structure.

-->For example, in an address list hash table you could store and sort data
 based on a key such as ZIP code rather than on a person's name.

-->The specific meaning of keys with regard to hash tables is totally dependent
on the usage of the hash table and the data it contains.
 */
/*
-->Hashtable was part of the original java.util and is a concrete implementation of a Dictionary.
-->However, Java 2 re-engineered Hashtable so that it also implements the Map interface.
-->Thus, Hashtable is now integrated into the collections framework.
-->It is similar to HashMap, but is synchronized.

-->Like HashMap, Hashtable stores key/value pairs in a hash table. When using a Hashtable, you specify an object that is used as a key,
 and the value that you want linked to that key. The key is then hashed,
and the resulting hash code is used as the index at which the value is stored within the table.
